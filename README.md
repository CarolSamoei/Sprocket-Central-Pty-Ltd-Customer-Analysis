# Main Findings
A total of  2777 customer demographics and 19.45k transactions cu were analyzed .

 Mass customers form the largest part of the customer base.
 
 Most customers come manufacturing and financial service industries. 
 
 Bicycles are mostly used by social workers and sales representatives.
 
 Solex and Giant bicycle brands have the highest demand. Solex demand can be explained by the low standard cost of the product. On the other hand, Giant bicycle is the 2nd highest demanded brand despite it having the highest standard cost. This may be due to its quality.
 
 Lastly, medium class products are highly demanded by the customers.
